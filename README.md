# holbertonschool Zero Day
Zero Day at Holberton School about Shell, Vagrant, Emacs, Vi, Git.

## Shell

A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.

## Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

## Emacs

Emacs is a popular text editor used mainly on Unix-based systems by programmers, scientists, engineers, students, and system administrators. 

## Vi

vi is a screen-oriented text editor originally created for the Unix operating system.

## Git

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.
